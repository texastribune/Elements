        This library provided as CustomElement abstract class that does some
        of the boiler plate for creating custom elements and provides some utility functions
        for working with elements. It also provides some implementations of common elements
        like tables and dialogs.

    <p>
        This library does not restrict you to any particular patterns, but does try to make certain
        patterns easier. For instance, you can use the updateFromAttributes method to update all
        element state. This works well in combination with storing all element state in the element's
        attributes. Using this pattern makes state management easier and preserves element state
        even when elements are copied via HTML strings.
